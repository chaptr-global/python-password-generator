# Python Password Generator
Secure Password Generator Python Script

# About Project 
This is a Python practice project for participants in the Chaptr Data Science Cohort. Below are the project details:

## Description
Internet Security has become a contentious issue in the modern-day. We are all opening accounts on different websites, from Facebook, Gmail, Chaptr, to some of those websites you open once a year. However, we cannot afford to think of different passwords for all these sites (some secure, other less so), therefore, we use a standard password or probably two/three password iterations. This has security implications; if a hacker gains your password from one site, they can easily hack all your other accounts some which hold more dear information such as your bank, or your classified emails (Letâ€™s pretend you are Hillary Clinton).

But guess what? You can now save passwords on your browser (Google Chrome, Firefox or Safari) and you can now afford to put random passwords in all the accounts you open on different sites without the worry of remembering these passwords!

## Overall Project Description
Welcome the Challenge! In this project, your goal is to generate a random password for a user that adheres to all password requirements so that we take this stress away from him.

- [] This project requires you to use Random Module tor randomize the password output. This is an easy Python module that you can learn by visiting the Randon Documentation. Here is what the program should entail:

- [] Once the program is run, it should output a password of random length with at least 8 characters but at most 20 characters
- [] The password should contain a lower-case letter, an upper-case letter, a numeric digit, and a special character (@, #, $, %, &, ! etc.)
- [] Remember to break down your approach to this challenge by introducing comments to make your code more readable/understandable. Also, adhere to the naming conventions and make your variable name descriptive.
